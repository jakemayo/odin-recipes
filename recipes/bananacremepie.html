    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Classic butter pie pastry, aka flaky pie crust, serves as the base of this pie—which can be made ahead, made and frozen or replaced with a store-bought crust (if you're pressed for time). It's filled with creamy homemade custard, fresh sliced bananas and a fluffy topping for an impressive end to your meal.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dough for single crust pie</li>
            <li>1-cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4-cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2-teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3-cups almond milk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten, room temperature</li>
            <li>3-tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>1-1/2 teaspoons of vinilla exract</li>
            <li>2 large firm bananas</li>
            <li>1-cup heavy whipping cream, whipped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. Trim crust to 1/2 in. beyond rim of plate; flute edge. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425°.</li>
            <li>Line crust with a double thickness of foil. Fill with pie weights, dried beans or uncooked rice. Bake on a lower oven rack until edge is golden brown, 20-25 minutes. Remove foil and weights; bake until bottom is golden brown, 3-6 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, salt and milk until smooth. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat; cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Stir a small amount of hot filling into eggs; return all to pan. Bring to a gentle boil; cook and stir 2 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Gently stir in butter and vanilla. Press plastic wrap onto surface of custard; refrigerate, covered, 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Spread half of the custard into crust. Slice bananas; arrange over filling. Pour remaining custard over bananas. Spread with whipped cream. Refrigerate 6 hours or overnight.</li>
        </ol>
